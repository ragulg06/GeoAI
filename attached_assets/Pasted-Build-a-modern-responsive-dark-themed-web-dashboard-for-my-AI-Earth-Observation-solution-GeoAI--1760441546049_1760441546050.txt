Build a modern, responsive, dark-themed web dashboard for my AI Earth Observation solution (GeoAI / TerraMind-OSS) with the following features:

Landing Page

Visually appealing hero section (dark mode).

Short explanation: "GeoAI is an open-source platform for real-time satellite image analysis, turning Earth Observation data into natural-language insights for ISRO & beyond."

Add SVG/PNG/animated EO satellite, globe, or multispectral imagery as visual elements.

Section for a “Competitive Edge” table or bullet points about multimodal, low-latency EO intelligence.

Clearly branded (logo, solution name).

External Links (top, right-side, or floating icons)

GitHub link icon (opens repo in new tab)

Hugging Face Spaces link icon (opens in new tab)

Tooltips on hover: "View on GitHub", "Try Model on Hugging Face Spaces"

Navigation

Dark mode navigation bar.

Tabs: "Home", "Chat", "Docs" (optional)

Chat Page

Chat interface styled like ChatGPT/Perplexity (dark mode).

Prompt input area at the bottom.

Prominent placeholder or “drag & drop” for image upload (supports .jpg, .png, .tif, etc).

1-click buttons (chips) for quick-use cases ABOVE OR IN prompt:

"Image Captioning"

"Visual Question Answering"

"Change Detection"

"Report Generation"

When a user clicks a chip, it should prefill the prompt with a sample question (e.g., “Describe this image”, “What is the main land cover?”).

When an image is uploaded, it should preview in the chat, and the inference is made with the selected use-case.

Features

Real-time response loading indicator (“GeoAI is thinking…”)

Scrollable chat history

Responses can include formatted text and optionally charts/images if returned by the backend

Error handling if user submits empty text or no image

Tech Stack

Use React (with Next.js or Vite) or Python (with FastAPI or Flask & Gradio), or a stack Auto detects—your choice.

Use TailwindCSS, Material UI, or Chakra UI for beautiful dark mode styling.

Should be mobile responsive.

Bonus

Floating feedback/help button (“?” icon)

Footer with links to documentation, privacy policy, and contact (dummy)

Integration/readiness for backend API calls (e.g., /api/chat endpoint)

Summary of user experience flow:

On site open: see a visually branded dark home page with about, visuals, and links.

Can navigate to chat tab or click “Chat” to go to interactive page.

In chat, user can upload EO image, pick use-case, enter text prompt, and see natural-language & analytic responses in real-time.

Do not use any paid/proprietary UI kit
